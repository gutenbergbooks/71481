</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>John H. Schaffner.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tumbleweeds may be classified under three general heads:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Annual tumbleweeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tumble-grasses,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perennial tumbleweeds.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The annual tumbleweeds are mostly plants with a small root
system which shrivels up or rots away soon after the seed has
matured. The plants are then easily torn from the ground or broken
off and go tumbling away before the wind. In some cases the roots
become quite fleshy and brittle. In the tumble-grasses the panicle
is generally the only part which is transported, the stems of the
panicle being usually very brittle and breaking readily even in those
forms which are easily torn up from the roots.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2. Plant of P floribunda, showing a part of the deep taproot.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The perennial tumbleweeds
are especially interesting because
of the way in which they
are separated from the underground
parts. Among the perennial
forms Psoralea floribunda
is one of the most
typical. It is a long-lived,
perennial crown-former with a
very deep root which may be
several inches in diameter.
From the short terminal stem
of this root a number of aerial
branches are developed annually.
These branches take on a
more or less globose or balloon-shaped
form. At the base of
each aerial stem a number of
special joints are formed in
which transverse cleavage
regions are gradually developed,
and when the seed is
ripe the whole crown breaks off at these
joints with remarkable ease. This is a peculiar
case of the development of a self-pruning
process in the stem for a very special
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Psoralea argophylla also develops perfect
joints but fewer shoots usually make up the
crown and it is therefore less conspicuous
than P. floribunda. Psoralea esculenta is also
a tumbleweed but the writer has not made
an examination of the way in which it separates
from the thick, tuberous, perennial root.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 3. (a) Base of a stem of P. floribunda with two cleavage joints. (b) Base of stem showing cleavage surface.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Psoralea floribunda is very abundant in
north-central Kansas where the writer has
seen great masses heaped up against hedgerows
and wire fences. These plants show a

  <h2 class='c008'>THE SPROUTING OF COCKLEBUR SEEDS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>E. E. Masterman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In July, 1896, Dr. E. W. Claypole, then of Buchtel College, Akron,
Ohio, asked me how general was the belief that one seed of the cocklebur
grew one year and the other the next year or later. Inquiry
of about twenty of the older residents resulted in procuring no information
touching the same. In 1897, I was told by a German
farmer that one seed only grew one year and the other later, never
both at the same time. A short time after I noticed the statement
of A. D. Selby in Bulletin 83, (page 353) Ohio Experiment Station, as
follows: “Prof. Arthur has recently shown that only one of these
seeds can be caused to germinate the first year, the other always remaining
until the second year.” This was a confirmation of the
German’s claim, yet I determined to investigate for myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>I carried on the experiment for three years with the following
results:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In 1898, I planted 1000 burs; 917 grew two plants to the bur.</div>
      <div class='line'>In 1899, I planted 1000 burs; 921 grew two plants to the bur.</div>
      <div class='line'>In 1900, I planted 1000 burs; 913 grew two plants to the bur.</div>
      <div class='line'>Total three years, 3000 burs; 2751 grew two plants to the bur.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the remaining 249 burs some grew one plant, some none; some
had one, some had two apparently sound seeds. I regret that no
further notice was taken of these seeds. The <i>only</i> object was to determine
whether the two seeds <i>could</i> be made to grow at the same
time. An account of the work was sent to Professor Selby, asking
whether further experiment was necessary; he replied that he
thought not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps it should be added that I selected only apparently sound
burs; soil was taken from a field near a creek where cockleburs
grow abundantly. It was passed through a ¼ inch-mesh wire sieve,
and carefully searched over with the aid of a glass. This soil was
taken to a distant part of the farm; in it the seeds were planted and
nature did the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>I also made observations as follows: I searched among specimens
growing for a mile along a creek, for two plants growing
together and not nearer than five inches to any other plant. Of
the 1500 specimens examined each year for three years, two plants
always grew from one bur.</p>

<p class='c007'>Why have I obtained such opposite results as compared with
Professor Arthur’s? Can it be referred to locality, soil, or some
other more favorable conditions?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The substance of the above was presented, December 27, 1900, to
the Ohio Academy of Science and it provoked a discussion in which
Professors Kellerman, Schaffner, Mosely and others participated.
Dr. Kellerman thought that the results of Arthur’s experiments were
perhaps more nearly in accord with what usually takes place in nature.
He pointed out the mistake of quoting or saying that Arthur
has shown “that only one of the seeds can be caused to germinate
the first year.” Turning to the printed report of the experiments in
question (Proc. 16th, An. Meeting Soc. Prom. Agr. Sci., 1895), I find
that, based on many experiments made previous to 1895, he gives
the result in round numbers as follows: “Out of every hundred ordinarily
well formed cockleburs, seventy will produce one seedling
each, and five two seedlings each the first year after maturity; the
remaining twenty-five will for various reasons fail to grow. Thirty
of the hundred will produce seedlings the second year after maturity,
five will produce seedlings the third year after maturity, and
two or three seedlings will be produced in subsequent years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later experiments by Dr. Arthur seemed to show a lower percentage
of cases of the sprouting of both seeds to the bur in one season.
In the summary he states: “The germination of both seeds of a
bur of Xanthium in one season is exceptional.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of the above and in accordance with the suggestions of
others I purpose continuing my experiments relative to this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following interesting statement is made by Dr. Arthur, in
the report cited, touching the cause of the difference in the action
of the two seeds; he says it “appears to be constitutional; a hereditary
character residing in the protoplasm of the embryo.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>PLANT REMAINS FROM THE BAUM VILLAGE SITE.</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>W. C. Mills.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>During the year 1900 the Ohio Archaeological and Historical
Society procured from the ash pits of the Baum Village Site, situated
near Bournville, Ross county, Ohio, a number of grains and seeds,
which were submitted to Prof. J. H. Schaffner for identification.
The following is the list:</p>

<p class='c007'>Corn, Zea mays L.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great quantities of the eight rowed variety were found. The cobs
were usually about one-half inch in diameter. Also a variety with
more than eight rows, usually ten rows was found. This variety
had a much thicker cob. The grains and cob were in a good state of
preservation, having been charred. In several instances the charred
remains of a woven fabric were found intermingled with the cobs
and grains, showing that the corn had evidently been wrapped in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>this cloth. In other instances the grains and cobs were found in
large pieces of broken pottery and were well preserved. Finding
the corn in so many of the pits shows that it largely supplied the
food of the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quantities of charred papaw seeds, Asimina triloba, (L.) Dunal,
and the wild Hazelnut, Corylus americana Walt. were found in a
number of pits showing that these were largely used for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite a quantity of the seeds of the wild red plum, Prunus americana
Marsh. was also taken from the pits. These were, in a number
of instances, associated with papaw seeds and the shells of the
chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great quantities of the broken shells of the butternut, Juglans
cinerea L. and the black walnut, Juglans nigra L. were discovered.
These were usually found associated together, but in several
instances they were found separated, the butternuts being more
abundant than the walnuts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three species of hickory nuts were procured but none of these
were in such quantities as the butternut and black walnut. The
three species found were as follows: Hicoria minima (Marsh.)
Britt., Hicoria ovata (Mill.) Britt., Hicoria laciniosa (Mx.) Britt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several specimens of beans, Phaseolus (sp) and also a specimen
of the grape, Vitis (sp.) were found in the material, but it was not
possible to tell whether the beans were one of our wild species or
cultivated.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>SPROUTING FLOWER BUDS OF OPUNTIA.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. V. Sterki.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In June of last year I took some Opuntia plants home, and also
some top joints heavily set with large buds. The former were
planted in the garden, the latter set in an Oleander tub. When,
after a month, none of the flower buds had opened, it was thought
that they were too many, as the joints bearing them were without
roots, and most of them were cut off and left lying on the ground,
where a part of them later on became partly or entirely covered
with soil. In September, I was surprised to find them all green and
fresh; most of them had rooted, and a few even sprouted, sending up
shoots from half an inch to over an inch high, being perfect little
joints. At the present writing (Jan. a. c.) all are alive, and, no
doubt, will grow out to plants next summer. They will be watched
closely and further report be given.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be added that the Opuntia calyx-tube, which is later
the fruit, has “eyes,” that is buds, of the same character as the
ordinary buds of the plant, with clusters of bristles; and out of these
the young shoots grew, when the bud took root.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Evidently these buds retain more of the nature of the mother
plant than is common in flowers. It is unknown to me whether
similar observations have been made before. But it would be of
interest to make experiments with different plants. Would the
receptacles root and sprout if detached after flowering and fertilization
have taken place? Would the buds sprout when left in situ on
the mother plant, after the flowering parts had been removed, the
receptacle only left in place? Will the buds of other genera of
Cacteae, and other similar succulent plants behave in the same way,
under favorable conditions?</p>

<p class='c007'>So-called viviparous plants are, as is well known, rather common,
e. g. among Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Polygoneae. But there the
actual flower parts develop into leaves, from which they had originally
been derived, and while yet remaining on the parent plant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Syndesmon thalictroides is described in Britton &#38; Brown’s Flora
as having sessile involucral leaves, which character is contradicted
in the plants growing in the vicinity of Toledo. Careful observation
during the past season fails to reveal a single instance of sessile
involucral leaves, and most of the specimens examined have these
leaves borne on petioles from one-fourth to one-half inch in length.
Should like to hear from others concerning this feature of one of our
most beautiful and dainty spring flowers.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>COMPETITION IN BOTANY FOR OHIO SCHOOLS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>W. A. Kellerman.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Whatever may contribute to a more direct and real study of the
plant kingdom on the part of the pupils can well be encouraged by
the teacher. It is an unfortunate fact that in reference to a course
in botany the notion largely prevails that it consists of lesson-work
with a text-book like a course in history or algebra. It is often
more dreaded than the latter because of the supposed necessity of
learning a long list of difficult technical terms. Few teachers would
be willing to give up the use of the text-book entirely and it is not
at all necessary that they should. But every teacher can now
choose a modern book of botany from the fairly long list that is
offered by American publishers. These are not mainly terminology
nor written with the chief aim of enabling the pupil, after having
gone through a sufficient number of chapters, to “analyze” flowers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Many of them unfortunately provide no means of identifying the
native plants as a part of a school course, but teachers are not left
without choice of a good book after such ultra ones are thrown out
of the list.</p>

<p class='c007'>The text of an elementary book on botany should contain the
important facts and principles of the science, and give a brief but
comprehensive idea of the plant kingdom, in simple and plain language.
An intimation and partial elucidation of means and methods
employed to test or to verify the principles and inferences should be
evident in the text. But this of itself is not sufficient for pedagogical
purposes; there should be besides practical work provided, regular
in time, ample in amount, that may train in the exercise of
observation, experimentation and judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have for years devoted one-half the time of the botanical courses,
both elementary and advanced, to such real work carried on partly
in the laboratory, partly in the field. Besides courses here referred
to others devoted wholly to laboratory, experimental or observational
work are provided; but it is not my purpose to discuss these
now. Neither is it necessary to give here a detailed outline of the
practical work that should constitute a substantial portion of the
elementary work for beginners. Those who wish to use such a simple
yet ample course in the public schools can consult the “Practical
Studies in Elementary Botany” published by Eldredge &#38; Bro., Philadelphia,
Pa.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I desire to say in this connection that more real work on the
native flora than is attempted even by able and enthusiastic teachers
in Ohio schools would undoubtedly be advisable. I have outlined
some competition work and submitted it to some of the schools looking
to more interest in elementary practical work in this science.
It has been urged that the project might be made more widely
known to our Ohio schools with possible advantage, and therefore I
have furnished, though with some misgivings, the following statement
of this scheme.</p>

<p class='c007'>Either of the following subjects may be selected: Mosses,
Lichens, or Trees; the work to conform to the suggestions and directions
given below. The Report of the work must be completed on or
before May 15, 1901, and submitted to the Teacher of Botany, or person
(or persons) designated by him, who—taking into account both
the quality and quantity of the work—will forward, if worthy, the
best report accompanied by the illustrative material, to the undersigned;
whereupon the latter will, on or before May 31, send as a
reward to the author of said report a copy of the <span class='sc'>Ohio Naturalist
Vol. 1</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pupils now studying, or those who have formerly studied, botany
are eligible to enter the competition. No award will be made unless
at least two or three pupils undertake the work; it is hoped that
every member of the class will compete.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>It is desired that the pupils consult teachers, parents, and others,
who may be able to advise as to the subject, kind and extent of the
work, also as to the best arrangement and wording of the report,
and the labelling and preparation of the accompanying illustrative
material.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report is to contain a detailed account of the work actually
done by the pupil and in no case to contain anything not his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names of those entering the competition must be sent to the
undersigned on or before March 30th. The suggestions, directions
and explanation of the three subjects proposed are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bryological.</span>—All the kinds of Mosses in the region should be
collected and put under slight pressure till dry; then a small portion
should be glued directly upon a piece of card-board and a larger
amount placed in a paper pocket and attached to the same piece;
the notes and drawings can also be attached to the same card-board
which for each species should be 8¼ x 11½ inches. Most of the kinds
(species) can be found in fruit; the latter is a capsule (little pod) on
a slender stem called the seta. Specimens without fruit are not
very satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tell in each case on what the specimen grows, as the ground,
tree trunk, old log, rock, boulder, etc.; add other notes relating to
its situation (habitat), abundance, appearance, general character
(habit), etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Draw an enlarged figure at least of the capsule (fruit) of some
or all of the species (kinds) collected. In the early stage there is
usually a cap (called calyptra) on the capsule. When the capsule
is ripe it opens by a lid (called the operculum) for the escape of the
spores. Notice the teeth (called collectively the peristome) surrounding
the mouth of the capsule—evident when the operculum
falls off.</p>

<p class='c007'>A good pocket lens must be used for this work. The drawings
must be clear; after completed with a sharp lead pencil it would be
well to retrace with a fine pen and india (or drawing) ink. Excessive
shading of the figures is objectionable.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a book is desired, a suitable one for beginners is Grout’s
“Mosses with a Hand-lens,” price $1.10; orders sent to the author
or to the writer of this article will be promptly attended to. But for
the purposes of this competition the botanical names of mosses are
not <i>required</i>; it will be of course more interesting if an attempt at
the identification of the species is in all cases made.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Lichenological.</span>—All the kinds of Lichens in the region should
be collected. The little disks, or saucer-like bodies, on the plants
are the fruit (called the apothecium); the apothecia are more distinct
and striking in appearance, as is the whole plant also, when
moist; therefore the best time to collect lichens is after a prolonged
rain, or when the air is moist; when dry they are usually brittle
and cannot be satisfactorily handled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Do not save specimens that have no fruit, except in case of rare
species. Only enough pressure on the specimens (placed between
blotters or soft papers) should be brought into requisition as is necessary
to keep them from curving or crumpling while drying. Then
glue a specimen to a card-board, 8¼ × 11½ inches, and also attach a
paper pocket containing ample material, and the drawings (if any are
attempted), also the notes, to the same piece of card-board. Use a
separate card-board for each kind (species).</p>

<p class='c007'>Tell the substratum on which the specimen was found—as boulders,
limestone, sandstone, log or stump, fence-rail, tree or plant,
soil, etc. Give additional notes as to appearance, size, abundance,
habitat, habit, etc. Those growing on rocks can not generally be
removed—a thin piece of rock must be chipped off to secure them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A detailed description should be written of each kind (species);
drawings perhaps might be undertaken; the different species should
be compared and contrasted. Use a good pocket lens. There is no
text-book on Lichens that is usable by beginners.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dendrological.</span>—The Trees may be studied from one of several
points of view. If a camera be used, selected trees should be studied
and illustrated; the bark compared in case of different species, likewise
in case of one and the same species when the individuals are of
different ages and sizes or grow in different situations or exposures;
also modes of branching compared and shapes contrasted. Very full
notes should be taken, and when written up in the report reference
should be made constantly to the numbered illustrations. Few or
many kinds of trees, as preferred, may be taken if this phase of the
subject is selected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of the above one may study and identify all the kinds
(species) of trees in the region. Full descriptions should be written
out, and similarities and contrasts of different species noted. Give
uses of the kinds of woods only when such use is made in the region
or the near town or city. Collect twigs and fasten them to card-boards
(8¼ × 11½ inches). Attach a specimen of the fruit also when
it can be found under the tree. A pamphlet (price 10 cents) with a
Key to the Ohio Forest Trees by means of which the names can be determined,
may be obtained from the writer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A third method of carrying out the work on trees would be to
give an account of the forest area in the region—either taking a
square or rectangular tract of a mile or more in extent; or selecting
if possible a natural area, as a river or creek valley, or other obviously
bounded tract of ample dimensions. Draw a map of the
selected region and locate thereon the forests and groups of trees.
Describe them, indicating the prominent kinds of trees, the less
abundant species, and the very rare ones. Tell approximately the
size of the largest, the commonest size, etc. Note uses made of some
of the kinds in the region or at a near manufactory. Record other
observations.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Taraxacum Erythrospermum.</span>—The Red-seeded Dandelion,
now known to be common in our State, is a late bloomer. An abundance
of flowers may be seen way after the severe frosts of autumn
set in. Mr. Fred. J. Tyler collected specimens in bloom at Perry,
Lake County, December 17. He reports “great fields” of it at that
place, whereas the common Dandelion (Taraxacum taraxacum) was
conspicuous by its absence. Prof. Beardslee of Cleveland, reports
the Red-seeded form as the one of common occurrence in Cuyahoga
County. I have noted the Red-seeded form in bloom near the city
of Columbus December 23, though the month has been a cold one,
the thermometer registering once 10° F. The Common Dandelion
(Taraxacum taraxacum) does not seem to bloom so late in the
season—at least it is in bloom much less abundantly here. Contributions
of phenological observations on interesting plants of
our flora by readers of <span class='sc'>The Naturalist</span> are in this incidental
way earnestly solicited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Grove of Large Beeches.</span>—There are now remaining in Ohio
very few large groves of beeches. Of groves of very large beeches
the same may be said. At Arion, in Scioto County, in the narrow
valley of Brush Creek, are a large number of magnificent specimens
of this very attractive American tree. The trunks are straight as is
always the case for this species, smooth, and many of them are ten
to twelve feet in circumference. One specimen measured twelve
feet four inches, three feet from the ground. The grove is now used
for picnic and camping purposes, and it is sincerely hoped that these
splendid trees may be sacredly preserved for an indefinite time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Habitat of Rhamnus Caroliniana.</span>—The manuals give the
habitat of this species “in swamps and on low grounds” (Britton),
“swamps and river banks” (Gray), “river banks” (Wood), and
“fertile soil” (Chapman). It has been previously reported that
this species was found in Ohio last November. Several specimens
were found near the Ohio river in Adams county at the mouth of
Brush creek, and a few were seen in Brown county. In a little
ravine on Cedar creek, a tributary of Brush creek, in Adams county,
fourteen miles north of the Ohio river, an enormous number of
plants were growing. Some were nine to eleven inches in circumference
at the base and fourteen feet high. None occurred in
“swamps,” though many were in “low grounds” where the soil
seemed to be fairly fertile. The majority were on rocky hillsides or
quite on the top of very high ground. The annexed cut shows a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>specimen near the top of a rocky bluff or hill perhaps one hundred
and fifty feet above the valley at Cedar Mills, Ohio. This southern
Buckthorn still retained its shining leaves though my visit was late
in November when nearly all the other trees except the oaks were
bare. This, with the great quantities of black fruits, presented a
charming spectacle. The plant is also reported in Stanley Coulter’s
catalogue of Indiana plants, discovered in the southern counties by
Mr. W. T. Blatchley, “growing on rocky hillsides.”</p>

occupy the same space at the same time. The cut above shows a
red oak and a beech in close juxtaposition, neither having been able
to crowd the other out, and the two are united for a short distance
from the ground. This would hardly be called a natural graft perhaps,
though the two are intimately united. The trees are vigorous
typical specimens of the two species, growing near Brush creek, at
Arion, in Scioto county, Ohio. Several other examples in the same
region were noticed. Sometimes the two trees are the same species,
but usually of different species, the union of tissue in all cases
equally evident.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>MEETING OF THE BIOLOGICAL CLUB.</h2>

<p class='c011'>A meeting of the Biological Club was held in Zoological Lecture-room
January 7, 1901. Professor Osborn presided; twenty-three
members present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Griggs, secretary of the board of editors gave a financial report
and recommended that the name of the publication be changed to
<span class='sc'>The Ohio Naturalist</span>. By the unanimous vote of the members
present, the recommendation was adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Hambleton read a paper on his Explorations in southern
Chile and Patagonia. He said:</p>

<p class='c007'>The expedition was sent out by the Chilean government and had
for its object the exploration of the coast from about 40° south latitude
to 48° in search of a river that might come from beyond the mountains.
This was done and a river called by the party <i>Baker River</i> was
discovered emptying into Baker channel at about 47° 20′ south latitude.
This river was followed in its course to the water-shed and
was found to be the outlet of Lake Cochrane, though its principal
source was not discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A study of the flora of the region traversed by the party brought
to light the following facts: That the Peninsula of Taitao marks
the division line between the rich and varied flora of the Llanquihue
region and the monotonous flora of the Magellan Strait region.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference between these two floras is really remarkable.
In the Llanquihue region no one species nor even genus can be said
to predominate. Character is given to the vegetation by the
<i>Chusquea quila</i> a sort of climbing bamboo. <i>Fuchsia macrostemma</i>
and a large variety of stately forest trees, all struggling together
for the mastery and making a forest as impenetrable as the Selvas
of the Amazon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Magellanic region is characterized by the predominance of
several species of <i>Nothofagus</i>. Immense forests may be found composed
exclusively of a single species, for example, the <i>N. pumila</i>,
and in all this region, extending from the Peninsula of Taitoa to Cape
Horn, a distance 10° of latitude, no other kind of tree acquires any
considerable size.</p>
